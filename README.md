# Amazon Route 53 Failover Routing

## Lab Completion Summary

This lab was focused on implementing failover routing using Amazon Route 53 for a simple web application. The goal was to ensure high availability and fault tolerance of the application by redirecting traffic between different server instances based on their operational status.

### Objective Achieved

The primary objective of this lab was to configure domain DNS settings such that traffic is automatically redirected to a secondary Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance in a different Availability Zone if the primary instance becomes unavailable. This setup provides a practical demonstration of using Amazon Route 53's failover routing capability to maintain application uptime during instance failures.

By the end of this lab, I successfully configured the DNS failover system. This ensures that the web application remains accessible, demonstrating effective disaster recovery and business continuity planning using AWS services.
